# Tensorflow-Intro

TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. TensorFlow is a rich system for managing all aspects of a machine learning system; however, this class focuses on using a particular TensorFlow API to develop and train machine learning models

TensorFlow can be defined as follows:

A popular Machine Learning library, particularly well suited for large-scale Machine Learning

A product by Google Brain team that is used in Google Photos, Google Search and Google Cloud Speech.

An open source software library for numerical computation using data flow or computational graphs

A distributed computing tool that enables colossus neural networks to be trained across distributed servers. Google has also launched a cloud service to run TensorFlow graphs.
