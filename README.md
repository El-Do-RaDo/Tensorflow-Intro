# Tensorflow-Intro

TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. TensorFlow is a rich system for managing all aspects of a machine learning system; however, this class focuses on using a particular TensorFlow API to develop and train machine learning models

TensorFlow can be defined as follows:

A popular Machine Learning library, particularly well suited for large-scale Machine Learning

A product by Google Brain team that is used in Google Photos, Google Search and Google Cloud Speech.

An open source software library for numerical computation using data flow or computational graphs

A distributed computing tool that enables colossus neural networks to be trained across distributed servers. Google has also launched a cloud service to run TensorFlow graphs.

Currently, the most famous deep learning library in the world is Google's TensorFlow. Google product uses machine learning in all of its products to improve the search engine, translation, image captioning or recommendations.

To give a concrete example, Google users can experience a faster and more refined the search with AI. If the user types a keyword a the search bar, Google provides a recommendation about what could be the next word.

HISTORY OF TENSORFLOW:

A couple of years ago, deep learning started to outperform all other machine learning algorithms when giving a massive amount of data. Google saw it could use these deep neural networks to improve its services,They build a framework called Tensorflow to let researchers and developers work together on an AI model. Once developed and scaled, it allows lots of people to use it.

It was first made public in late 2015, while the first stable version appeared in 2017. It is open source under Apache Open Source license. You can use it, modify it and redistribute the modified version for a fee without paying anything to Google.

WHERE CAN TENSORFLOW RUN??

TensorFlow hardware, and software requirements can be classified into

Development Phase: This is when you train the mode. Training is usually done on your Desktop or laptop.

Run Phase or Inference Phase: Once training is done Tensorflow can be run on many different platforms.

You can train it on multiple machines then you can run it on a different machine, once you have the trained model.

The model can be trained and used on GPUs as well as CPUs. GPUs were initially designed for video games. In late 2010, Stanford researchers found that GPU was also very good at matrix operations and algebra so that it makes them very fast for doing these kinds of calculations. Deep learning relies on a lot of matrix multiplication. TensorFlow is very fast at computing the matrix multiplication because it is written in C++. Although it is implemented in C++, TensorFlow can be accessed and controlled by other languages mainly, Python.

Finally, a significant feature of TensorFlow is the TensorBoard. The TensorBoard enables to monitor graphically and visually what TensorFlow is doing.
