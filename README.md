# Tensorflow-Intro

TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. TensorFlow is a rich system for managing all aspects of a machine learning system; however, this class focuses on using a particular TensorFlow API to develop and train machine learning models
Mathematically a Tensor is a N-dimensional vector, means a Tensor can be used to represent N-dimensional datasets.
